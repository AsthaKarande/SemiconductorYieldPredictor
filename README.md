# SemiconductorYieldPredictor
The primary objective of this project is to develop a classifier model that predicts the pass/fail yield of a specific process entity in semiconductor manufacturing. Additionally, this project aims to investigate the relevance of all features in building the model, identifying potential redundancies or opportunities for feature optimization.
